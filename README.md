# DSC-VOID-Bubble

Description:
This C program demonstrates the implementation of Bubble Sort algorithm. In this program, an array of integers is sorted in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Algorithm:

Declare a function named Bubble that accepts an integer array and the size of the array as arguments.
Declare a variable named passes and set its value to n - 1 where n is the size of the array.
Declare variables named comparisons, i, j, and temp.
Start a loop that will run for i from 0 to passes-1.
Set the value of comparisons to n - 1 - i.
Start a loop that will run for j from 0 to comparisons-1.
Check if a[j] is greater than a[j+1]. If true, swap the values of a[j] and a[j+1].
End both loops.
Declare a function named main.
Declare an integer array named a and initialize it with some values.
Declare an integer variable named n and set its value to 5.
Call the Bubble function and pass the array a and value of n as arguments.
Start a loop that will run for i from 0 to n-1.
Print the value of each element of the array a.
End the loop.
End the main function.

Output:
20 41 54 119 123
